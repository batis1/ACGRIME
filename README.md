# ACGRIME

## Overview

ACGRIME is an enhanced version of the RIME optimization algorithm. It integrates chaos theory, adaptive chaotic weighting, and Gaussian mutation to address the limitations of the RIME algorithm, including issues with population diversity and local optima. ACGRIME demonstrates superior performance in global optimization and feature selection tasks.
